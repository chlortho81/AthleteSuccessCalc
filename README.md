# Java1Final
Final Project for Java1 NEU

I created this write read program for my Java 1 final project. The program is supposed to
calculate the success index of an athlete. It's application would be for a company that 
wants to determine if an athlete is worth sponsoring, based on the athlete's past performace.

The read file has some bugs that still need to be worked out.
